# Churn-Analysis-Using-Python
This project performs a detailed analysis of customer churn behavior in a telecom company using Python and data visualization techniques. The primary objective is to identify the key drivers of churn—why customers leave the service—and to extract actionable business insights that can help reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.I’ve included the dataset used in the analysis (Customer Churn.csv) in this repository.
